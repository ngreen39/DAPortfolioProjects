### 🔍 Key Metrics Tracked
* **Value for Money:** Correlation between ticket price and passenger satisfaction.
* **Ground Service vs. In-Flight:** Identifying if delays happen on the tarmac or in the air.
* **Global Sentiment:** Reviews filtered by **Continent** to see regional performance.

## 💡 Key Findings
* **Food vs. Value:** Passengers are 30% more likely to rate "Value for Money" poorly if the Food Continent rating is below 3 stars.
* **Ground Service:** This was the highest-rated category in European routes but lowest in North American routes.
